Primary parotid gland malignancies with direct extension in to the ear canal are excluded; the ICCR Carcinomas of the major salivary glands dataset should be used. Haematolymphoid neoplasms are also excluded from this dataset.\n\nNeck dissections and nodal excisions are dealt with in a separate dataset, and this dataset should be used in conjunction, where applicable.\n\nFor bilateral tumours, a separate dataset should be completed for each tumour.\n\nThis dataset is intended for use for primary tumour resections. For resections of recurrent disease, the reporting guide may be used pragmatically although some data elements may be not applicable nor assessable.\n\nICCR Ear and Temporal Bone Tumours Bookmarked guide - 1 MB ICCR Ear and Temporal Bone Tumours Hyperlinked guide - 3320 KB ICCR Ear and Temporal Bone Tumours Dataset on Word - 7368 KB Publication History These datasets were developed with the kind support of the North American Society of Head and Neck Pathology (NASHNP), American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology (AAOMP), International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathologists (IAOP), and British Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology (BSOMP). 2nd edition – July 2024 Updated following the publication of the 2024 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Head and Neck Tumours, 5th edition.
