  "scope": "The dataset has been developed for the reporting of primary cancer resection and biopsy specimens of malignancies arising from the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands). For resections of recurrent disease, the reporting guide may be used pragmatically although some data elements may be not applicable nor assessable. Melanomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets. Minor salivary gland malignancies arising in the oral cavity, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, larynx, hypopharynx, trachea, nasopharynx, oropharynx, gnathic bones, and ear-temporal bone specimens are staged according to their anatomical sub-site and are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets. Minor salivary gland tumours are rare with insufficient quality evidence currently to support a separate dataset, recognising this is a limitation. Further, the ICCR follows Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) guidance for staging, and the major salivary gland system is not applicable to minor salivary glands. The notes on histological typing and grading in this dataset may be used to inform reporting of minor salivary gland malignancies. In addition, neck dissections and nodal excisions are dealt with in a separate dataset, and this dataset should be used in conjunction, where applicable. For bilateral tumours, a separate dataset should be completed for each tumour.\nThe dataset has been developed for the reporting of primary cancer resection and biopsy specimens of malignancies arising from the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands).

For resections of recurrent disease, the reporting guide may be used pragmatically although some data elements may be not applicable nor assessable. Melanomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets. Minor salivary gland malignancies arising in the oral cavity, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, larynx, hypopharynx, trachea, nasopharynx, oropharynx, gnathic bones, and ear-temporal bone specimens are staged according to their anatomical sub-site and are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets. Minor salivary gland tumours are rare with insufficient quality evidence currently to support a separate dataset, recognising this is a limitation. Further, the ICCR follows Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) guidance for staging, and the major salivary gland system is not applicable to minor salivary glands. The notes on histological typing and grading in this dataset may be used to inform reporting of minor salivary gland malignancies. In addition, neck dissections and nodal excisions are dealt with in a separate dataset, and this dataset should be used in conjunction, where applicable. For bilateral tumours, a separate dataset should be completed for each tumour.

Epub 2018 Nov 30. ​ Expert Committee The 2nd edition of the dataset for Carcinomas of the major salivary glands was developed by the following international team: Chair and Series Champion – Lester Thompson, USA ICCR representative – Tim Helliwell, UK Domain experts: Justin Bishop, USA Martin Hyrcza, Canada Stefan Ihrler, Germany Ilmo Leivo, Finland Toshitaka Nagao, Japan Niels Rupp, Switzerland Alena Skalova, Czech Republic Göran Stenman, Sweden Vincent Vander Poorten, Belgium Carla van Herpen, The Netherlands Authors of the previous edition of this dataset are available here .\n\nDatasets > Published Datasets > Head and Neck > Carcinomas of the Major Salivary Glands\n\nCarcinomas of the Major Salivary Glands\n\nThe dataset has been developed for the reporting of primary cancer resection and biopsy specimens of malignancies arising from the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands). For resections of recurrent disease, the reporting guide may be used pragmatically although some data elements may be not applicable nor assessable. Melanomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets. Minor salivary gland malignancies arising in the oral cavity, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, larynx, hypopharynx, trachea, nasopharynx, oropharynx, gnathic bones, and ear-temporal bone specimens are staged according to their anatomical sub-site and are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets. Minor salivary gland tumours are rare with insufficient quality evidence currently to support a separate dataset, recognising this is a limitation. Further, the ICCR follows Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) guidance for staging, and the major salivary gland system is not applicable to minor salivary glands. The notes on histological typing and grading in this dataset may be used to inform reporting of minor salivary gland malignancies. In addition, neck dissections and nodal excisions are dealt with in a separate dataset, and this dataset should be used in conjunction, where applicable. For bilateral tumours, a separate dataset should be completed for each tumour.\n\nThe dataset has been developed for the reporting of primary cancer resection and biopsy specimens of malignancies arising from the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands).
