Epub 2018 Nov 30.​ Expert Committee The 2nd edition of the dataset for Carcinomas of the hypopharynx, larynx and trachea was developed by the following international team: Chair – Nina Zidar, Slovenia Series Champion – Lester Thompson, USA ICCR representative and domain expert – Tim Helliwell, UK Domain experts: Munita Bal, India Rebecca Chernock, USA Jane Dahlstrom, Australia Bayardo Perez-Ordonez, Canada Primož Strojan, Slovenia Authors of the previous edition of this dataset are available here .\n\nDatasets > Published Datasets > Head and Neck > Carcinomas of the Hypopharynx, Larynx and Trachea\n\nCarcinomas of the Hypopharynx, Larynx and Trachea\n\nThe dataset has been developed for the reporting of resection and biopsy specimens of invasive epithelial malignancies of the larynx, hypopharynx and trachea. Salivary-type malignancies arising from minor mucoserous glands of the hypopharynx and larynx should be recorded in this dataset. Mucosal melanoma is presented in a separate ICCR dataset. Lymphomas and sarcomas are not included. Malignancies arising at other sites in the head and neck region, and neck dissections and nodal excisions are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets which may be used, as appropriate, in conjunction with this dataset. Where more than one anatomically or histologically distinct primary tumour occur, a separate dataset should be completed for each tumour. This dataset is intended for use for primary cancer resections. For resections of recurrent disease, the reporting guide may be used pragmatically but some data items may be not applicable or not assessable.\n\nThe dataset has been developed for the reporting of resection and biopsy specimens of invasive epithelial malignancies of the larynx, hypopharynx and trachea.
