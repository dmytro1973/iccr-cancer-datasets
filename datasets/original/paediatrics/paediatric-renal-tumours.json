Rarely, other primitive tumours of childhood (including neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumour, desmoplastic small round cell tumour, among others) arise within the kidney but not within renal precursor cells; these should be staged and treated according to recommendations specific for their diagnosis. This dataset does not apply to these tumours, or to procedures involving only biopsy.\nFor bilateral tumours, complete a separate dataset for each kidney. For multifocal unilateral tumours, complete a single dataset."
