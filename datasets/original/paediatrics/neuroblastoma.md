Neuroblastoma
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathological reporting of biopsy and resection specimens of paediatric peripheral neuroblastic tumours.
Most such tumours in adults are benign ganglioneuromas; there is a paucity of evidence to support classification and treatment guidelines of neuroblastomas and ganglioneuroblastomas in patients over 10 years old due to their rarity.
Treatment, especially traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can alter the histologic appearance and composition of neuroblastic tumours. These changes may or may not reflect the original classification of the tumour or its original or future biologic behaviour. Thus, much of this dataset is not suitable for use with post-treatment tumours.
In those rare cases where more than one primary tumour is present, separate datasets should be completed for each neoplasm.
