The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens of endometrial cancers, including carcinosarcomas. It is not applicable for small endometrial biopsy specimens. Haematopoietic neoplasms, mesenchymal neoplasms, adenosarcomas, malignant melanomas, other non-epithelial malignancies and metastatic tumours are excluded from this dataset. Adenosarcoma and other mesenchymal neoplasms are included in the ICCR Uterine malignant and potentially malignant mesenchymal tumours dataset.
