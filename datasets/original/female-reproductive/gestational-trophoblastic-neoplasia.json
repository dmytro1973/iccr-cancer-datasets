The dataset should be used primarily for hysterectomy specimens. This dataset may also be used for rare myomectomy specimens but not all elements will be applicable. The dataset is not intended to be used for extrauterine primary lesions.\nNon-gestational trophoblastic tumours (germ cell or somatic origin) and metastatic tumours are excluded from this dataset."
