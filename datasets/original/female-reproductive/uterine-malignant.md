Uterine Malignant and Potentially Malignant Mesenchymal Tumours
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens of the uterus for sarcomas and mesenchymal tumours with potentially malignant behaviour. The dataset is applicable to tumours of the uterine corpus and the uterine cervix.
Carcinomas, other non-mesenchymal malignancies and metastatic neoplasms are excluded from this dataset. Carcinosarcoma is also excluded as it is considered to represent a malignant epithelial tumour with divergent mesenchymal differentiation based on clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical and molecular analysis; as such, this entity is included in the ICCR Endometrial Cancer dataset.

Publication History
This dataset was developed with the kind support of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists (ISGyP).
Minor update to the 1st edition – Version 1.1 August 2021.
