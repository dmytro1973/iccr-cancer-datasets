Molecular studies have shown that some of these ‘recurrent’ neoplasms exhibit similar mutations and are clonally related to the original tumour and are likely to represent true recurrences while others are clonally unrelated with different mutations and are likely to represent new neoplasms.\nIn those rare cases where more than one primary tumour is present, separate datasets should be completed for each neoplasm. These should include all the elements in this dataset, except for lymph node status which does not need to be documented separately for each tumour.\nHaematopoietic neoplasms, mesenchymal neoplasms, mixed epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms, malignant melanomas, other non-epithelial malignancies and metastatic tumours are excluded from this dataset."
