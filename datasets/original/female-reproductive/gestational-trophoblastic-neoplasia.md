Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasias
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens for primary uterine gestational trophoblastic neoplasia which includes invasive hydatidiform mole of either complete or partial type, gestational choriocarcinoma, placental site trophoblastic tumour and epithelioid trophoblastic tumour. The dataset should be used primarily for hysterectomy specimens. This dataset may also be used for rare myomectomy specimens but not all elements will be applicable. The dataset is not intended to be used for extrauterine primary lesions.
Non-gestational trophoblastic tumours (germ cell or somatic origin) and metastatic tumours are excluded from this dataset.
