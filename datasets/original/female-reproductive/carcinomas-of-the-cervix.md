Carcinomas of the Cervix
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of primary cervical carcinomas. Specimens reported using this dataset include loop/cone excisions, trachelectomies, simple and radical hysterectomies and exenterations. The dataset applies to epithelial neoplasms only. Small biopsy specimens are excluded from the dataset.
In those rare cases where more than one primary tumour is present, separate datasets should be completed for each neoplasm. These should include all the elements in this dataset, except for lymph node status which does not need to be documented separately for each tumour.

Publication History
These datasets were developed with the kind support of the International Society of Gynecological Pathologists (ISGyP).
5th edition
– October 2023
The 5th edition of this dataset incorporates the 2021 Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) Cervix Uteri TNM.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
• Incorporation of the 2021 UICC Cervix Uteri TNM.
• Incorporation of Distant metastasis (pM) into the ‘TNM staging’ element (omitted ‘Pathologically confirmed distant
metastasis’ element).
• Added a new element ‘Deepest location of tumour within cervical stroma’.
• Updated the ‘Histological tumour type’ element.
• Updated the ‘Lymph node status’ element.
• Revised notes for ‘Block identification key’, ‘Histological tumour type’ (including the World Health Organization Classifications table),
‘Lymph node status’ and ‘Ancillary studies’.
• Other minor updates were also included.
