Ovary, Fallopian Tube and Primary Peritoneal Carcinomas
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens of primary borderline and malignant epithelial tumours of the ovary, fallopian tubes and peritoneum. It does not include non-epithelial ovarian neoplasms such as germ cell or sex cord stromal tumours or other primary peritoneal neoplasms such as mesothelioma. In those rare cases where more than one primary tumour of different morphological types is present, separate datasets should be completed for each neoplasm. These should include all the elements in this dataset, except for lymph node status which does not need to be documented separately for each tumour.

Publication History
