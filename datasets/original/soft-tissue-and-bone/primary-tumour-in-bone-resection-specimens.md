## Primary Tumour in Bone – Resection Specimens

Datasets > Published Datasets > Soft Tissue and Bone > Primary Tumour in Bone – Resection Specimens Scope The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens of primary tumour in bone. Ewing sarcoma and related round cell sarcomas with primary bone presentation are also covered in this dataset. A separate ICCR dataset is available for reporting of biopsy specimens of primary tumour in bone. Some types of soft tissue sarcoma may on rare occasion arise primarily in bone and should be reported using the primary tumour in bone dataset, rather than the soft tissue sarcoma dataset. Haematologic malignancies and metastatic specimens are excluded from this dataset.
