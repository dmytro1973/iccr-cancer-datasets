## Overview

Datasets Soft Tissue Sarcoma – Resection Specimens

## Soft Tissue Sarcoma – Resection Specimens

Datasets > Published Datasets > Soft Tissue and Bone > Soft Tissue Sarcoma – Resection Specimens Scope The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens for soft tissue sarcomas. Adult rhabdomyosarcoma is also included in this dataset. A separate ICCR dataset is available for reporting of biopsy specimens for soft tissue sarcomas. Some soft tissue tumours which rarely arise primarily in bone and in this case should be reported using the ICCR primary tumour in bone datasets. Lymphoma, uterine sarcoma, paediatric rhabdomyosarcoma and metastases are excluded from this dataset. Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) are also not included in this dataset as GIST displays a number of unique features which warrant its separate consideration; separate ICCR datasets for GIST are available.
