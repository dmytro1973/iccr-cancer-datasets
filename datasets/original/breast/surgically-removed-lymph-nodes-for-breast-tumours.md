Surgically Removed Lymph Nodes for Breast Tumours
Scope
This dataset has been developed for the reporting of surgically removed ipsilateral lymph nodes (including lymph node dissection, targeted axillary surgery, nodal sampling and sentinel node biopsy specimens) for breast tumours. It is not intended for use in reporting core biopsy or fine needle aspiration of lymph nodes. The assessment of ipsilateral lymph nodes is part of nodal staging of breast cancer, whereas the rare contralateral lymph node involvement is currently interpreted as distant metastasis and is not part of the dataset.
The reporting of invasive breast cancer and in situ disease (ductal carcinoma in situ, pleomorphic and florid lobular carcinoma in situ, encapsulated papillary carcinoma and solid papillary carcinoma in situ) are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets which may be used, as appropriate, in conjunction with this dataset.

Publication History
This dataset was developed with the kind support of the International Society of Breast Pathology (ISBP) and Singapore General Hospital (SGH) – Breast Pathology Course.
