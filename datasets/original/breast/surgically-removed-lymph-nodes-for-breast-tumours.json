It is not intended for use in reporting core biopsy or fine needle aspiration of lymph nodes. The assessment of ipsilateral lymph nodes is part of nodal staging of breast cancer, whereas the rare contralateral lymph node involvement is currently interpreted as distant metastasis and is not part of the dataset.\nThe reporting of invasive breast cancer and in situ disease (ductal carcinoma in situ, pleomorphic and florid lobular carcinoma in situ, encapsulated papillary carcinoma and solid papillary carcinoma in situ) are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets which may be used, as appropriate, in conjunction with this dataset."
