Invasive Carcinoma of the Breast
Scope
This dataset has been developed for the reporting of resection specimens from patients with invasive carcinoma of the breast, with or without ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). DCIS without invasive carcinoma and microinvasive carcinoma (≤1 mm) are dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset.
Ipsilateral multifocal disease should be dealt with in a single report. For bilateral invasive breast tumours, a separate dataset should be completed for each side.
Surgically removed lymph nodes are dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset which may be used, as appropriate, in conjunction with this dataset. Invasive breast cancer for the post neoadjuvant setting is also dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset.
Phyllodes tumours and needle biopsies are not covered in this dataset.

Publication History
These datasets were developed with the kind support of the International Society of Breast Pathology (ISBP) and Singapore General Hospital (SGH) – Breast Pathology Course.
