The protocol applies to cases of DCIS and for where microinvasion (≤1 mm) is present. It also covers other in situ lesions including pleomorphic and florid variants of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), as well as encapsulated papillary carcinoma and solid papillary carcinoma in situ. This dataset may also be used in those rare cases of DCIS removed at core biopsy but without evidence of residual DCIS in a subsequent excision specimen. This protocol should only be used for re-excisions when they contain the largest extent of DCIS.\nA separate dataset should be completed for bilateral DCIS and for each excision specimen in unilateral disease.\nDCIS (with or without microinvasion) diagnosed on needle core biopsies only, and residual DCIS post neoadjuvant therapy are outside the scope. Separate ICCR datasets cover DCIS associated with invasive breast carcinomas and breast resections in the neoadjuvant setting. Surgically removed lymph nodes are covered in a separate ICCR dataset which may be used, as appropriate, in conjunction with this dataset."
