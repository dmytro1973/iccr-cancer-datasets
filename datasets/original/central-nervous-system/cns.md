Tumours of the Central Nervous System (CNS)
Scope
This dataset has been developed for benign and malignant primary tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) and its coverings, as well as tumours from those structures of the peripheral nervous system immediately adjacent to the CNS. This dataset applies to both biopsy and resection specimens of adult and paediatric CNS tumours.
Haematological lesions involving the CNS and germ cell tumours are not covered in detail as these are not the primary focus of the CNS dataset. Most sarcomas are not included and are covered by separate ICCR datasets. Secondary tumours of the CNS (for example, metastatic tumours from carcinomas, sarcomas or melanomas in other organs) are not covered in this dataset. Tumours of the pituitary gland are included as the majority of these tumours are reported by neuropathologists worldwide.
Tumours of the Central Nervous System (CNS).
The dataset is split into three sections:
Histological assessment of CNS specimens
. It is intended that this section should be used in conjunction with the other sections, where appropriate. A complete diagnosis of CNS tumours should ideally conform to the final integrated diagnoses in the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the CNS, which for most tumour types now require integration of elements from histological and ancillary analyses. Nonetheless, it is realised that some diagnoses may not fit precisely within existing diagnostic categories.
Molecular information for CNS specimens
. This section has been developed for the molecular assessment of primary CNS tumours, whether that molecular assessment is nucleic acid or protein-based. This section is to be used for those tumours in which molecular information is captured for diagnostic purposes.
Final integrated report/diagnosis for CNS specimens
. This dataset section should be used in conjunction with the sections on ‘Histological assessment’ and ‘Molecular information’, where appropriate.

Publication History
2nd edition
– September 2024
Updated following the publication of the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System, 5th edition.
This 2nd edition dataset was developed with the kind support of the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands, and Stichting STOPHersentmoren, The Netherlands.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Histological Assessment section
• Revised guide to harmonise with ICCR style for element titles and value list.
• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style.
• Prior therapy was renamed and incorporated as a non-core sub-value in ‘Clinical information’, the latter containing both core and non-core sub-values.
• ‘Tumour site’ was changed to a core element (applicable for some tumours).
• ‘Histological appearance’ was changed to a core element, applicable for when the element is an essential component of the final (integrated) diagnosis.
• ‘Histological tumour grade’ renamed ‘Tumour grade’ and moved to the Integrated diagnosis section.
• ‘Invasion’ element title was changed to ‘Invasion into surrounding tissue/structures’.
• Notes, references and Table 1 were revised; Table 2 added.
Molecular Information section
• Revised guide to harmonise with ICCR style for element titles and value list.
• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style; Tables 1-4 added.
• New and existing elements for molecular alterations (2-38) were upgraded to core to reflect their status as essential diagnostic criteria in the WHO CNS 5th edition Tumour Classification; commentary added to allow consideration for core elements to be downgraded to non-core until resources allow.
• Revised guide to include ‘Representative blocks for ancillary studies’.
• Added new core Molecular Information elements to align with essential diagnostic criteria in the WHO CNS 5th edition Tumour Classification:
ALK/ROS1/MET
/NTRK family alterations,
BCOR
internal tandem duplication,
CIC
alterations,
DICER1
alterations, FET alterations,
FOXR2
alterations, MAPK pathway alterations, Methylome profiling,
MN1
alterations,
MYB/MYBL1
alterations,
PDGFRA
alterations,
PRC2
inactivation,
PRKAR1A
inactivation,
PRKCA
inactivation, SHH pathway alterations, TTF1 expression (IHC), WNT pathway alterations,
ZFTA
rearrangement, and Other immunohistochemistry findings.
• The following Molecular Information elements were omitted (or can be included within other elements): PTEN, Ki-67, medulloblastoma immunohistochemistry, monosomy 6, and
RELA
.
Integrated Final Diagnosis section
• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style.
• ‘Histological tumour grade’ was moved to the Integrated diagnosis section and renamed ‘Tumour grade’.
• Revised guide element ‘Integrated final diagnosis based on’ to also include WHO CNS 5th edition Tumour  Classification, CNS WHO grade, and immunohistochemistry.
• The note for ‘Diagnosis not elsewhere classified’ was incorporated into the note for ‘Integrated final diagnosis’.
• Notes, references and Table 1 were revised; Table 2 and a note for ‘Integrated diagnosis based on’ were added.
