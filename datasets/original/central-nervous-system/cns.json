This dataset applies to both biopsy and resection specimens of adult and paediatric CNS tumours.\nHaematological lesions involving the CNS and germ cell tumours are not covered in detail as these are not the primary focus of the CNS dataset. Most sarcomas are not included and are covered by separate ICCR datasets. Secondary tumours of the CNS (for example, metastatic tumours from carcinomas, sarcomas or melanomas in other organs) are not covered in this dataset. Tumours of the pituitary gland are included as the majority of these tumours are reported by neuropathologists worldwide.\nTumours of the Central Nervous System (CNS).\nThe dataset is split into three sections:\nHistological assessment of CNS specimens\n. It is intended that this section should be used in conjunction with the other sections, where appropriate. A complete diagnosis of CNS tumours should ideally conform to the final integrated diagnoses in the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the CNS, which for most tumour types now require integration of elements from histological and ancillary analyses. Nonetheless, it is realised that some diagnoses may not fit precisely within existing diagnostic categories.\nMolecular information for CNS specimens\n. This section has been developed for the molecular assessment of primary CNS tumours, whether that molecular assessment is nucleic acid or protein-based. This section is to be used for those tumours in which molecular information is captured for diagnostic purposes.\nFinal integrated report/diagnosis for CNS specimens\n. This dataset section should be used in conjunction with the sections on ‘Histological assessment’ and ‘Molecular information’, where appropriate."
