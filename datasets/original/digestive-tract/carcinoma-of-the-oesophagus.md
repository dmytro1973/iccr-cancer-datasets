Carcinomas of the Oesophagus
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens of the oesophagus. Carcinomas involving the oesophagogastric junction (OGJ) with tumour epicentre ≤20 millimetres into the proximal stomach are included. A separate ICCR dataset is available for endoscopic resections of the oesophagus and oesophagogastric junction.
Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN) of the oesophagus are included.
Neuroendocrine tumours (NET), non-epithelial malignancies such as melanoma, and secondary tumours are excluded from this dataset.
