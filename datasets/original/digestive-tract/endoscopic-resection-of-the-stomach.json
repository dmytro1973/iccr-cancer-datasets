Surgically resected specimens are covered in a separate ICCR dataset.\nCarcinomas involving the oesophagogastric junction (OGJ) with their epicentre >20 millimetres into the proximal stomach and cardia cancers that do not involve the OGJ are included. These criteria are set by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 9th edition/American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition TNM classifications and have been adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and define the diagnosis ‘gastric cancer’. An ICCR dataset for carcinoma of the oesophagus is available for tumours not meeting these criteria.\nNeuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) (with the exception of mixed adenoma and neuroendocrine tumours (NETs)) are included in this dataset.\nNeuroendocrine tumours (NETs), non-epithelial malignancies, and secondary tumours are excluded from this dataset."
