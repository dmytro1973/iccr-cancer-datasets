Colorectal Excisional Biopsy (Polypectomy) Specimen
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the reporting of local excision specimens from the colon and rectum, including polypectomies, endoscopic mucosal resections (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissections (ESD), endoscopic full thickness resections (EFTR), transanal submucosal excisions, transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) and transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEMS) specimens.
Surgical resection specimens from patients with primary carcinoma of the colon and rectum, including neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs), are dealt with in a separate dataset.
The dataset is recommended for the reporting of neuroendocrine neoplasms (neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) and (NECs)) diagnosed from local excision specimens and thus differs from the dataset for the reporting of primary carcinoma of the colon and rectum in surgical resection specimens from which NETs are excluded.
