Scope
The dataset has been developed for the reporting of surgical resection specimens from patients with primary carcinoma of the colon and rectum, including neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs). It is not applicable to carcinomas of the small intestine, appendix or anus, nor to neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) or non-epithelial malignancies.
Primary colorectal carcinomas treated by local excision are dealt with in a separate dataset.
