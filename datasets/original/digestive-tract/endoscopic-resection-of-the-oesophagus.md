Endoscopic Resection of the Oesophagus and Oesophagogastric Junction
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of endoscopic resection (ER) of pre-malignant and malignant lesions of the oesophagus and oesophagogastric junction (OGJ). Surgically resected specimens are covered in a separate ICCR dataset.
Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN) of the oesophagus are included.
Neuroendocrine tumours (NET), non-epithelial malignancies such as melanoma, and secondary tumours are excluded from this dataset.
