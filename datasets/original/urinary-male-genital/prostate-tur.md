Prostate Cancers – Transurethral Resection and Enucleation
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the examination of transurethral resection or enucleation (suprapubic/simple/open prostatectomy or laser enucleation) specimens of the prostate. The dataset applies to invasive carcinomas of the prostate gland. Core biopsies and radical prostatectomy specimens are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets. Urothelial carcinomas arising in the bladder or urethra are dealt with in separate datasets. Rare urothelial carcinomas arising within the prostate are included in a separate ICCR dataset.
