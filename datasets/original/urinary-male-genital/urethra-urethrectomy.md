Carcinomas of the Urethra – Urethrectomy Specimen
Scope
The dataset has been developed for pathology reporting resection specimens from patients with primary carcinoma (non-invasive and invasive) of the urethra. Biopsy and transurethral resection specimens are dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset. Carcinomas arising in the very distal penile urethra (fossa navicularis/merging with glans penis) are usually HPV-associated squamous cell carcinomas and are included in the ICCR Carcinoma of the penis and distal urethra dataset and are not to be reported using this dataset. This dataset is also used for adenocarcinoma arising in the accessory urethral glands (Skene, Littre, Cowper). Most studies of primary urethral carcinoma exclude recurrence of urothelial carcinoma in the urethra following cystectomy. The latter is considerably more common than ”de novo” urothelial carcinoma of urethra and should not be reported using this dataset.
Primary carcinoma of the urethra is rare and as such there are limited data regarding the prognostic significance of descriptive pathologic parameters.

Publication History
2nd edition
– December 2025
Updated following the publication of the 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition.

• Revised guide to harmonise with ICCR style for element titles and value list.
• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style.
• Updated the ‘Clinical information’ element.
• Renamed the ‘Macroscopic tumour site’ element ‘Tumour site’ and updated.
• Renamed the ‘Maximum tumour dimension’ element ‘Tumour dimensions’ and changed to a non-core element.
• ‘Macroscopic extent of invasion’ was changed to a non-core element and updated.
• Updated the ‘Histological tumour type’ element to the 5th edition WHO Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours.
• Updated the ‘Non-invasive carcinoma’ element.
• Updated the ‘Histological tumour grade’ element.
• Updated the ‘Microscopic extent of invasion’ element.
• Renamed the ‘Regional lymph node status’ element ‘Lymph node status’ and updated.
