Carcinomas of the Penis and Distal Urethra
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the reporting of specimens from patients with carcinoma of the penis, including resection, biopsy, and lymphadenectomy. The protocol applies to primary carcinoma of the penis, as well as distal urethral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in males.
The male urethra is divided into the anterior and posterior urethra. The anterior urethra extends from the perineal membrane to the urethral meatus and is divided into the bulbar urethra (surrounded by the bulbospongiosus), and the penile urethra, which includes the fossa navicularis (surrounded by corpus spongiosum). The corpora cavernosa and the tunica albuginea extend only into the proximal part of the glans penis.
SCCs of the fossa navicularis are reported using this dataset, while those arising from the proximal anterior urethra are reported using the ICCR Carcinomas of the urethra dataset.
Melanomas and other urethral carcinomas are not included in the scope of this dataset – separate ICCR datasets are available and should be used for these neoplasms.
The second edition of this dataset includes changes to align the dataset with the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours, Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition, 2022. The ICCR dataset includes 5th edition Corrigenda, July 2024. In development of this dataset, the DAC considered evidence up until August 2024.
Gross images are included in this dataset given the complexity of this carcinoma to improve consistency of recording data.

Publication History
2nd edition
– November 2024
Updated following the publication of the 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition.
This 2nd edition dataset was developed with the kind support of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP).
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
• Updated to Union for International Cancer Control TNM8 staging, including errata published July 2024.
• Revised guide to harmonise with ICCR style for element titles and value list.
• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style.
• Updated the ‘Clinical information’ element.
• Updated the ‘Operative procedure’ element.
• Renamed ‘Macroscopic tumour site’ element to ‘Tumour site’ and updated.
• Removed ‘Macroscopic maximum tumour dimensions’ and ‘Microscopic maximum tumour dimensions’ elements and added a new element ‘Tumour dimensions’.
• Updated the ‘Extent of invasion’ element to also include ‘Tumour thickness’ and ‘Depth of invasion’ as non-core items.
• Added a new element ‘Tumour pattern of invasion’.
• Updated the ‘Histological tumour type’ element.
• Updated the ‘Lymph node status’ element.
• Added a new element ‘Coexistent pathology’.
• Added a new element ‘Ancillary studies’.
• Other minor updates to elements were also included.
• Revised all notes, including incorporation of the 2022 WHO Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition.
