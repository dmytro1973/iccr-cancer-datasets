Renal Biopsy for Tumours
Scope
The dataset has been developed for biopsy specimens for neoplasms of renal tubular origin. Excision specimens are not included – a separate ICCR dataset is available and should be used for these cases.
Urothelial carcinoma arising from the upper renal tract, Wilms tumours and other nephroblastic and mesenchymal tumours are not included. Metastatic tumours are excluded from this dataset. This dataset is not to be used for clearly benign tumours, such as papillary adenoma and oncocytoma. However other neoplasms of uncertain behaviour (e.g., clear cell papillary tumours, other oncocytic tumours) may be reported using this dataset.
This dataset is designed for the reporting of a single laterality of specimen i.e., left or right. If both lateralities are submitted then separate datasets should be completed.

Publication History
2nd edition
– May 2025
Updated following the publication of the 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition.
This 2nd edition dataset was developed with the kind support of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP).
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
• Revised guide to harmonise with ICCR style for element titles and value list.
• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style.
• Updated the ‘Operative procedure’ element.
• Updated the ‘Specimen laterality’ element.
• Added a new element ‘Block identification key’.
• Renamed ‘Histological tumour grade’ to ‘Provisional histological tumour grade’.
• Renamed ‘Sarcomatoid morphology’ to ‘Sarcomatoid features’.
• Renamed ‘Rhabdoid morphology’ to ‘Rhabdoid features’.
• Updated the ‘Coexisting pathology in non-neoplastic kidney’ element.
• Updated the ‘Ancillary studies’ element, including adding ‘Representative blocks for ancillary studies’.
• Other minor updates to elements were also included.
• Revised all notes, including incorporation of the 2022 WHO Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition.
