Prostate – Core Needle Biopsy
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the examination of prostate core needle biopsies. The dataset applies to invasive carcinomas of the prostate gland. Transurethral resection and enucleation specimens and radical prostatectomy specimens are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets. Urothelial carcinomas arising in the bladder or urethra are dealt with in separate datasets. Rare urothelial carcinomas arising within the prostate are included in a separate ICCR dataset.
The second edition of this dataset includes changes to align the dataset with the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours, Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition, 2022. The ICCR dataset includes 5th edition Corrigenda, July 2024. In development of this dataset, the DAC considered evidence up until July 2024.
The prostate biopsy reports can be done using Specimen level reporting or Case level reporting. The following commentary applies to both specimen level and case level reporting of prostate core needle biopsies. Reporting by either specimen level or case level will be sufficient or users may also use both. Choosing which reporting to use will depend on your local practice or institutional preference, as well as regional or national recommendations.
