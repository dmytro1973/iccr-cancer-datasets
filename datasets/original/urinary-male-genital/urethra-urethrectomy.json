Biopsy and transurethral resection specimens are dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset. Carcinomas arising in the very distal penile urethra (fossa navicularis/merging with glans penis) are usually HPV-associated squamous cell carcinomas and are included in the ICCR Carcinoma of the penis and distal urethra dataset and are not to be reported using this dataset. This dataset is also used for adenocarcinoma arising in the accessory urethral glands (Skene, Littre, Cowper). Most studies of primary urethral carcinoma exclude recurrence of urothelial carcinoma in the urethra following cystectomy. The latter is considerably more common than ”de novo” urothelial carcinoma of urethra and should not be reported using this dataset.\nPrimary carcinoma of the urethra is rare and as such there are limited data regarding the prognostic significance of descriptive pathologic parameters."
