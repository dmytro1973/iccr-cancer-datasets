The dataset does not apply to sex cord-stromal tumours of the testis or to extra-gonadal germ cell tumours. The former have different criteria for malignancy from germ cell tumours, and the latter have an entirely separate staging system dependent on location. Sex cord stromal tumours are complex, with some types being entirely benign while others can be malignant. They are therefore too complex to include within this germ cell tumour focussed proforma. Paratesticular malignancies are also excluded for similar reasons. This dataset does not include information on the excision of residual metastatic masses after chemotherapy. A separate ICCR dataset is available for the reporting of retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy specimens.\nFor bilateral tumours, complete a separate dataset for each tumour."
