Germ Cell Tumours of the Testis – Orchidectomy
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the reporting of both partial and radical orchidectomy specimens from patients of any age with germ cell neoplasia of the testis. The dataset does not apply to sex cord-stromal tumours of the testis or to extra-gonadal germ cell tumours. The former have different criteria for malignancy from germ cell tumours, and the latter have an entirely separate staging system dependent on location. Sex cord stromal tumours are complex, with some types being entirely benign while others can be malignant. They are therefore too complex to include within this germ cell tumour focussed proforma. Paratesticular malignancies are also excluded for similar reasons. This dataset does not include information on the excision of residual metastatic masses after chemotherapy. A separate ICCR dataset is available for the reporting of retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy specimens.
For bilateral tumours, complete a separate dataset for each tumour.

Publication History
2nd edition
– November 2024
Updated following the publication of the 2022 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition.
This 2nd edition dataset was developed with the kind support of the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP).
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
• Updated to Union for International Cancer Control TNM8 staging, including errata published July 2024.
• Changed the title of the dataset from ‘Neoplasia of the testis’ to ‘Germ cell tumours of the testis’.
• Revised guide to harmonise with ICCR style for element titles and value list.
• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style.
• Updated the ‘Clinical information’ element.
• Renamed ‘Intratubular lesions’ to ‘In situ intratubular lesions’.
• Revised guide to include ‘Representative blocks for ancillary studies’.
• Other minor updates to elements were also included.
• Revised all notes, including incorporation of the 2022 WHO Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition.
