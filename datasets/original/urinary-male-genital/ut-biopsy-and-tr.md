Urinary Tract Carcinomas – Biopsy and Transurethral Resection Specimen
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of biopsy and transurethral resection (TUR) specimens of the bladder, urethra, ureter and renal pelvis. The protocol applies to primary carcinomas (non-invasive and invasive), with or without associated epithelial lesions. Urothelial tumours diagnosed as papilloma or papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential are not carcinomas and this dataset does not apply to those diagnoses. The most distal portion of the penile urethra in the region of the glans penis is not included in this dataset; it is covered in the ICCR Carcinoma of the penis and distal urethra dataset. Biopsy of the kidney is dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset.
If biopsies are from different locations, then a separate dataset should be completed for each tumour site.

Publication History
2nd edition

• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style.
• Updated the ‘Clinical information’ element.
• Updated the ‘Histological tumour type’ element to the 5th edition WHO Classification of Urinary and Male Genital Tumours.
• Updated the ‘Non-invasive carcinoma’ element.
• Updated the ‘Histological tumour grade’ element.
• Updated the ‘Status of muscularis propria’ element.
• Updated the ‘Extent of invasion’ element.
• Updated the ‘Substaging T1 disease’ element.
