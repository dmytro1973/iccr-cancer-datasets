Carcinomas of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter – Nephroureterectomy and Ureterectomy Specimen
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens from patients with primary carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter. The protocol applies to carcinomas (non-invasive and invasive), with or without associated epithelial lesions. Biopsy specimens are dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset. For bilateral tumours, complete a separate dataset for each.
