The dataset applies to invasive carcinomas of the prostate gland. Core biopsies and radical prostatectomy specimens are dealt with in separate ICCR datasets. Urothelial carcinomas arising in the bladder or urethra are dealt with in separate datasets. Rare urothelial carcinomas arising within the prostate are included in a separate ICCR dataset."
