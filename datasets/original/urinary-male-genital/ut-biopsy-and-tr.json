The protocol applies to primary carcinomas (non-invasive and invasive), with or without associated epithelial lesions. Urothelial tumours diagnosed as papilloma or papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential are not carcinomas and this dataset does not apply to those diagnoses. The most distal portion of the penile urethra in the region of the glans penis is not included in this dataset; it is covered in the ICCR Carcinoma of the penis and distal urethra dataset. Biopsy of the kidney is dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset.\nIf biopsies are from different locations, then a separate dataset should be completed for each tumour site."
