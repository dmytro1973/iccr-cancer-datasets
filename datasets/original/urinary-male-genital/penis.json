The protocol applies to primary carcinoma of the penis, as well as distal urethral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) in males.\nThe male urethra is divided into the anterior and posterior urethra. The anterior urethra extends from the perineal membrane to the urethral meatus and is divided into the bulbar urethra (surrounded by the bulbospongiosus), and the penile urethra, which includes the fossa navicularis (surrounded by corpus spongiosum). The corpora cavernosa and the tunica albuginea extend only into the proximal part of the glans penis.\nSCCs of the fossa navicularis are reported using this dataset, while those arising from the proximal anterior urethra are reported using the ICCR Carcinomas of the urethra dataset.\nMelanomas and other urethral carcinomas are not included in the scope of this dataset – separate ICCR datasets are available and should be used for these neoplasms.\nThe second edition of this dataset includes changes to align the dataset with the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours, Urinary and Male Genital Tumours, 5th edition, 2022. The ICCR dataset includes 5th edition Corrigenda, July 2024. In development of this dataset, the DAC considered evidence up until August 2024.\nGross images are included in this dataset given the complexity of this carcinoma to improve consistency of recording data."
