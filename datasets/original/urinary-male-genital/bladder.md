Carcinomas of the Bladder – Cystectomy, Cystoprostatectomy and Diverticulectomy Specimen
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of cystectomy, cystoprostatectomy or diverticulectomy specimens from patients with carcinoma of the bladder. The dataset applies to primary carcinomas (non-invasive and invasive), with or without associated epithelial lesions. The dataset also applies to urachal tumours. Biopsy and transurethral resection specimens are dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset.
