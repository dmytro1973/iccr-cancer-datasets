Excision specimens are not included – a separate ICCR dataset is available and should be used for these cases.\nUrothelial carcinoma arising from the upper renal tract, Wilms tumours and other nephroblastic and mesenchymal tumours are not included. Metastatic tumours are excluded from this dataset. This dataset is not to be used for clearly benign tumours, such as papillary adenoma and oncocytoma. However other neoplasms of uncertain behaviour (e.g., clear cell papillary tumours, other oncocytic tumours) may be reported using this dataset.\nThis dataset is designed for the reporting of a single laterality of specimen i.e., left or right. If both lateralities are submitted then separate datasets should be completed."
