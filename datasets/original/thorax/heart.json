It includes both benign and malignant primary tumours of the heart, pericardium, and great vessels.\nMesothelioma and haematolymphoid neoplasms (such as primary cardiac lymphoma) are not included in this dataset. For pericardial mesotheliomas refer to the ICCR Mesothelioma in the pleura and peritoneum dataset. Haematolymphoid tumours will be covered in a future ICCR dataset. Metastatic lesions should not be recorded using this dataset.\nThere is currently no agreed-upon staging system (such as TNM) for cardiac tumours, due to an insufficiency of evidence."
