Lung Cancers
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of resection specimens of malignant epithelial cancers of the lung. The dataset applies to small cell carcinoma and carcinoid tumours, as well as non-small cell types of lung carcinoma. While originally used primarily for non-small cell lung carcinoma, the TNM staging system has since also been validated for small cell carcinoma and carcinoid tumours.
Benign tumours may be reported at the discretion of the pathologist though not all core elements will be applicable, e.g., TNM staging. It is not applicable for bronchoscopic and transthoracic biopsy specimens. Synchronous primary tumours should be reported separately, denoting each staging with a suffix of ‘m’ so that multiplicity is documented. Data from non-epithelial tumours should be collected using other ICCR datasets, where available (e.g., primary pulmonary lymphomas, sarcomas).
