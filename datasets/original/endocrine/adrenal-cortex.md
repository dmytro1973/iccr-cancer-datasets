Carcinomas of the Adrenal Cortex
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of malignant adrenal cortical resection specimens. Borderline (low-malignant potential lesions) are included, along with paediatric adrenal cortical carcinomas. Core needle biopsies, benign adrenal cortical lesions and tumours, as well as sarcoma, lymphoma and metastases are not included. Neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastomas are not covered in the dataset. Other tumours of the adrenal medulla (e.g., paraganglioma) are dealt with in a separate dataset.
This dataset is designed for the reporting of a single laterality of specimen i.e., left or right. If both are submitted then separate datasets should be completed

Publication History
2nd edition
– November 2025
Updated following the publication of the 2025 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Tumours, 5th edition.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
• Updated to Union for International Cancer Control TNM9 staging, including errata published October 2025.
• Revised guide to harmonise with ICCR style for element titles and value list.
• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style.
• Updated the ‘Clinical information’ element to include ‘Clinical endocrine status’.
• Updated the ‘Specimen integrity’ element.
• Added a new non-core element ‘Block identification key’.
• Renamed the ‘Lymphatic invasion’ element ‘Lymphatic (sinusoidal) invasion’.
• Renamed the ‘Necrosis’ element ‘Tumour necrosis’.
• Updated the ‘Margin status’ element.
• Expanded the ‘Ancillary studies’ element, including adding ‘Representative blocks for ancillary studies’.
• Other minor updates to elements were also included.
