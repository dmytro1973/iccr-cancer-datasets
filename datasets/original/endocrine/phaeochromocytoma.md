Phaeochromocytoma and Paraganglioma
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of adrenalectomy/partial adrenalectomy specimens for phaeochromocytoma, other excisions for paragangliomas and biopsies of related specimens.
Sarcoma, lymphoma and metastasis to the adrenal medulla are not covered in this dataset. Neuroblastoma and ganglioneuroblastoma are covered in a separate ICCR dataset. Adrenal cortical tumours are dealt with in a separate ICCR dataset.
Further details of the scope of this dataset are outlined within the reporting guide.
