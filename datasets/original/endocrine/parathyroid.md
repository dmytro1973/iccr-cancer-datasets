Parathyroid Carcinomas and Atypical Parathyroid Neoplasms
Scope
The dataset has been developed for the pathology reporting of parathyroid resection specimens when the diagnosis is atypical parathyroid neoplasm (atypical parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma). No dataset is utilised for parathyroid hyperplasia or parathyroid adenoma of usual type. Biopsies are not included. Sarcoma, lymphoma and metastasis are not covered in this dataset.

Publication History
2nd edition
– November 2025
Updated following the publication of the 2025 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Tumours, 5th edition.
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
• Updated to Union for International Cancer Control TNM9 staging, including errata published October 2025.
• Revised guide to harmonise with ICCR style for element titles and value list.
• Revised scope for clarity and to harmonise with ICCR style.
• Updated the ‘Clinical information’ element.
• ‘Pre-operative biochemical information’ was changed to a core element (apart from the ‘other’ category which remained non-core).
• ‘Operative findings’ was changed to a core element (apart from the ‘other’ category which remained non-core) and ‘cystic’ was added.
• Added a new non-core element ‘Specimen dimensions’.
• Added a new non-core element ‘Block identification key’.
• Updated the ‘Mitotic count’ element.
• Renamed the ‘Necrosis’ element ‘Tumour necrosis’.
• Removed the element ‘Histological tumour grade’.
• Updated the ‘Extent of invasion’ element.
• Renamed the ‘Lymphovascular invasion’ element to make two new elements ‘Lymphatic invasion’ and ‘Vascular invasion’.
• Updated the ‘Margin status’ element.
• Updated the ‘Ancillary studies’ element, including changing ‘Ki-67 proliferation index’ to core and adding ‘Representative blocks for ancillary studies’ as non-core.
• Other minor updates to elements were also included.
• Revised all notes, including incorporation of the 5th edition WHO Classification of Endocrine and Neuroendocrine Tumours.
